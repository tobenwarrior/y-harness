# Run Y Harness on your VPS

Run the Y Harness Web profile on a Linux VPS you control. Its user service starts at boot and keeps running when you close your browser or SSH connection. The Web listener stays on the VPS's loopback address. You reach it through your existing SSH login.

## Prepare the VPS

Use a regular SSH account on a Linux server with systemd user services, Git, Python 3, curl, npm, a C compiler, and a compatible Node.js installation with development headers. Ubuntu 24.04 with Node.js 24 LTS is the initial setup target. On Ubuntu, `build-essential` provides the compiler. Keep port 3080 available on the VPS and on your local computer.

## Install and start

Connect to the VPS over SSH and paste this command. The first setup builds the public source and can take several minutes.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin &&
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobenwarrior/y-harness/master/scripts/setup-vps.py -o ~/.local/bin/yharness-vps &&
  python3 ~/.local/bin/yharness-vps
```

If setup reports that your user cannot enable lingering, ask the VPS administrator to run `sudo loginctl enable-linger YOUR_USER`, then retry setup. This lets systemd keep the user service running without an active login.

## Open Y Harness

On your computer, replace `your-vps` with the SSH destination you normally use and run:

```sh
ssh -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 127.0.0.1:3080:127.0.0.1:3080 your-vps \
  'python3 ~/.local/bin/yharness-vps url && exec sleep infinity'
```

Open the printed sign-in link in your browser and keep it private. Leave the command running while you use Y Harness. You can close the tunnel and reconnect later while the service continues on the VPS. [Set up your models and workspace](./index.md) in the VPS Web interface.

## Check the service

On the VPS, run `python3 ~/.local/bin/yharness-vps status`. Setup keeps the source checkout, the working directory, and Y Harness state in separate locations under `~/.yharness-vps`. Provider settings and logs stay in that private directory. Keep the host log private because it contains the sign-in link.

The service restarts after a process failure and loads saved state when it starts. An interrupted task may need your attention. Rerunning setup reuses the installed build and leaves a running service in place.
